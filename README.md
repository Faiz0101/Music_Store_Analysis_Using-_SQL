# SQL Project: Music Store Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing data from a fictional music store using SQL. The goal is to extract key insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and music inventory. By leveraging SQL queries, we aim to provide valuable data-driven insights to optimize business operations.

## Objectives
- **Customer Analysis**: Identify customer demographics, purchase patterns, and high-value customers.
- **Sales Analysis**: Analyze sales trends, revenue by genre, and track top-performing tracks, albums, and artists.
- **Inventory Insights**: Assess inventory turnover and identify high-demand items.
- **Geographic Analysis**: Evaluate sales across regions to identify strong markets and growth opportunities.

## Data Source
The data comes from a relational database, consisting of tables such as:
- **Customers**: Customer demographics and location
- **Invoices**: Sales information for each transaction
- **Invoice_Items**: Detailed information about each sale item
- **Tracks**: Music tracks available in the store
- **Albums**: Albums and their associated artists and genres
- **Artists**: Artist details
- **Genres**: Music genres associated with each track

## Key SQL Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Extraction**: Using SELECT statements to retrieve relevant data.
- **Data Aggregation**: Leveraging GROUP BY and aggregate functions for summary statistics.
- **Joins**: Combining tables to provide deeper insights.
- **Filtering**: Applying WHERE and HAVING clauses to refine data results.
- **Subqueries**: Using subqueries for advanced data analysis.
- **Window Functions**: Ranking and partitioning data for analysis across different dimensions.
